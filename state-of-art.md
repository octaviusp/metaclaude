# Project State of Art

## Current State Summary
The MetaClaude project is in a well-defined, mid-development stage. The foundational components and core architecture are in place, as evidenced by the detailed implementation plan (`PLAN.md`) and the existing source code structure. The project is functional, with a clear execution flow for taking a user's "idea" and orchestrating a Docker-based AI code generation process. The primary focus is on providing a robust, extensible, and secure environment for automated software creation.

## Active Features
*   **CLI Interface**: A comprehensive command-line interface built with `Typer`, supporting a variety of flags for customized execution. Includes utility commands (`doctor`, `agents`, `validate`).
*   **Docker Isolation**: Code generation is fully containerized in a Docker environment for security and reproducibility.
*   **Dynamic Agent Selection**: The system can analyze a project idea to automatically select the most relevant AI agents for the task. This can also be manually overridden.
*   **Template-based Configuration**: Project and agent configurations are generated dynamically using a `Jinja2` templating system, allowing for flexible and context-aware instructions for the AI.
*   **Multi-Source Configuration**: The application can be configured via CLI arguments, environment variables, and a configuration file, with a clear order of precedence.
*   **Extensible Agent System**: New agents can be added by creating new Markdown files in the `templates/.claude/agents` directory, making the system easily extensible.
*   **Rich Logging and Monitoring**: The tool provides detailed logging to both the console and a log file, with `Rich` formatting for better readability.

## Architecture Status
The current architecture is a modular, orchestrated system. It is stable and well-suited for the project's goals. The separation of concerns between the `Orchestrator` and the various `Managers` (Docker, Template, Config, etc.) allows for clear logic and maintainability. The use of `Pydantic` for configuration modeling ensures data integrity throughout the application.

## Change Log
### 2025-08-01 - Renaming and Refinement
*   Project renamed from "Virtual Claude Code" to "MetaClaude".
*   Core components updated to reflect the new name.
*   `pyproject.toml` and `README.md` updated with the new project name and script entry points.
*   The main execution flow from CLI input to Docker container execution is implemented and stable.
*   The agent and template systems are defined and functional.

## Feature Evolution History

### New Additions

*   **Template Management (`vcc/templates/manager.py`)**: Dynamically generates AI configuration from templates. @ 2025-08-01
*   **Agent Selection (`vcc/agents/selector.py`)**: Implements logic for selecting appropriate AI agents. @ 2025-08-01
*   **Configuration Management (`vcc/config/manager.py`)**: Manages loading configuration from multiple sources. @ 2025-08-01

## Technical Evolution
The project was initiated with a modern Python stack, leveraging best practices for CLI development, dependency management, and code quality.

*   **Initial Stack**:
    *   Python 3.9+
    *   Poetry for dependency management.
    *   Typer for the CLI.
    *   Docker SDK for container management.
    *   Jinja2 for templating.
    *   Pydantic for data validation.
    *   Black, Ruff, and MyPy for code quality.

The technology stack is current and does not show any signs of significant technical debt or outdated practices at this stage.

## Data Flow Evolution
The data flow has been designed from the start to be unidirectional and clear:

`User Input -> Configuration -> Analysis -> Template Rendering -> Docker Execution -> Filesystem Output`

This flow is robust and has not undergone significant changes since its initial design, as reflected in the project's planning documents.
